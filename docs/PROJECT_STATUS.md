# AMA-RT Project Status

This document is the at-a-glance status board for AMA-RT V1.4. It is
intentionally short. The full phase-gate ledger lives in
`docs/PHASE_GATE.md`; per-phase deep dives live in their own
`PHASE_*` documents.

## Live safety flags (Phase 1 lock)

```
trading_mode                    = paper
live_trading_enabled            = False
right_tail_enabled              = False
llm_enabled                     = False
exchange_live_order_enabled     = False
telegram_outbound_enabled       = False
binance_private_api_enabled     = False
```

The Phase 1 safety lock in `app/config/settings.py::_apply_phase1_safety_lock`
hard-coerces the first five flags. The Phase 11C
`MarketDataConfig` and `SafetyConfig` schemas refuse to load any
deployment that flips a `forbid_*` flag.

## Why the Phase 11C real-data acceptance is paused

The first 24h test against the real Binance public REST endpoints
(`fapi.binance.com`) exposed two failure modes the original Phase 11C
runner did not protect against:

  1. HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). Binance returned this once the
     per-IP weight budget was exceeded. The runner kept polling and
     escalated to:
  2. HTTP 418 (I'm a teapot). Binance uses 418 to signal a real IP
     ban.

Phase 11C's safety lock held throughout (`mode=paper`,
`live_trading=False`, no API key, no signed endpoint, no real order),
but the gateway was unusable for real-data acceptance until the
rate-limit problem is fixed.

**Phase 11C.1A** (PR-A in this branch) ships the fix in three layers:

  - a new `BinancePublicRestGovernor`
    (`app/exchanges/binance_rate_limit.py`) that wraps every public
    REST call, tracks the rolling weight budget, sleeps the
    `Retry-After` window on 429, latches into protection mode on
    418, and opens a P1 incident;
  - lower defaults (`symbol_limit=5`, `rest_poll_interval_seconds=60`,
    `weight_budget_per_minute=300`, soft 0.50 / hard 0.75);
  - a layered REST runner that does `exchangeInfo` / `ticker/24hr`
    only at bootstrap and refuses per-symbol detail REST calls
    unless a candidate ranking selects them (PR-B work).

PR-B (WebSocket-first all-market radar) and PR-C (cluster exposure
control + multi-candidate priority ranking) are tracked separately
and have NOT landed in this branch.

## What Phase 11C is

Phase 11C is real **Binance public market data** read-only paper.
It connects to public REST endpoints (`/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo`,
`/fapi/v1/ticker/24hr`, `/fapi/v1/klines`, `/fapi/v1/aggTrades`,
`/fapi/v1/depth`, `/fapi/v1/fundingRate`, `/fapi/v1/openInterest`,
`/fapi/v1/premiumIndex`, `/fapi/v1/ticker/bookTicker`), feeds the
data through the existing `MarketDataBuffer` and Risk Engine, and
emits the full Phase 11C event chain into `events.db`.

## What Phase 11C is NOT

- NOT live trading
- NOT connected to the Binance trading API
- NOT consuming any Binance API key / API secret
- NOT calling any signed endpoint
- NOT calling any account / position / leverage / margin endpoint
- NOT connected to DeepSeek
- NOT connected to a real Telegram bot
- NOT connected to 币安广场
- NOT a path into Phase 12

## Open phase

**Phase 11C.1B - WebSocket-First All-Market Demon Coin Radar (PR-B).**
Acceptance criteria + test matrix in
`docs/PHASE_11C_PUBLIC_MARKET_READONLY.md` §11C.1B. Acceptance
gate: every test in `tests/unit/test_phase11c_1b_ws_radar.py`,
`tests/unit/test_phase11c_1b_real_ws_adapter.py`, and
`tests/unit/test_phase11c_1b_routed_public_market_ws.py`
passes; the four ExchangeClientBase write surfaces still refuse;
the Phase 1 safety lock is unchanged; no listenKey / user data
stream / private WebSocket / trading WS API / `/private` routed
endpoint; the Phase 11C real-data acceptance run resumes once
PR #32 merges (PR-B now ships the routed real-network public WS
adapter inline).

## Phase 11C.1B - what it ships

PR-B adds three new modules + extends two existing ones:

  - `app/exchanges/binance_public_ws.py` -
    `BinancePublicWSClient` + `WSConfig` + `WSMessage` +
    `WSMessagePump` + `InProcessWSPump` + `_RefusalTransport`
    (default; refuses any real-network call) +
    **`StdlibPublicWSTransport`** (real-network RFC 6455 client
    built on the Python standard library only, route-aware) +
    **`MultiTransportPublicWSManager`** (owns one routed
    `StdlibPublicWSTransport` per route - PUBLIC + MARKET - and
    merges their messages behind a single `WSMessagePump`
    interface) + `create_real_public_ws_transport` factory +
    `classify_stream_route` + `split_streams_by_route` +
    `assert_public_ws_stream_allowed` +
    `assert_public_ws_url_allowed` +
    `assert_public_ws_path_allowed`. Stream allowlist:
    `!ticker@arr`, `!miniTicker@arr`, `!bookTicker`,
    `!markPrice@arr`, `!forceOrder@arr`. Stream-route
    classification: `!bookTicker` is the PUBLIC route;
    `!ticker@arr` / `!miniTicker@arr` / `!markPrice@arr` /
    `!forceOrder@arr` are the MARKET route. Path-root
    acceptance allowlist: `/public/ws`, `/public/stream`,
    `/market/ws`, `/market/stream` (legacy unrouted `/ws` /
    `/stream` are kept as back-compat for the in-process pump
    fixtures only). Forbidden path roots: `/private`, `/ws-api`,
    `/ws-fapi`, `/ws-papi`, `/trading-api`, `/userDataStream`.
    Host allowlist: `fstream.binance.com`,
    `fstream.binancefuture.com`. The transport refuses every
    credential-shaped kwarg (`api_key` / `api_secret` /
    `listen_key` / `token` / `signature` / `passphrase`) and
    never reads `BINANCE_API_KEY` / `BINANCE_API_SECRET`.
  - `app/market_data_public/radar.py` -
    `AllMarketRadarSnapshot` (frozen pydantic model) +
    `AllMarketRadarBuffer` (per-symbol rolling state) +
    `pre_anomaly_score_light` (pure additive scoring with
    deterministic reason tags).
  - `app/market_data_public/candidate_pool.py` - `CandidatePool`
    with default `candidate_pool_size=20`, `active_detail_limit=3`,
    `candidate_ttl_seconds=900`. Each candidate carries a
    Phase 8.5 `OpportunityIdentity` with
    `source_phase="phase_11c_1b_ws_first_radar"`.
  - `app/market_data_public/ws_radar_chain.py` -
    `WSRadarChainDriver` emits PRE_ANOMALY_DETECTED ->
    ANOMALY_DETECTED -> STATE_TRANSITION (+ Phase 8.5
    LearningReadyContext on each, + RISK_REJECTED via the live
    RiskEngine) per ACTIVE candidate.
  - `app/core/events.py` - three new EventType entries:
    `PUBLIC_WS_CONNECTED`, `PUBLIC_WS_DISCONNECTED`,
    `PUBLIC_WS_STALE`.
  - `app/paper_run/daily_report.py` - `DailyReportSnapshot` +
    `DailyReportBuilder` extended with WS + radar metrics; new
    `Phase 11C.1B WebSocket all-market radar` Markdown section.
  - `scripts/run_public_market_paper.py` - new CLI flags
    `--ws-first` (default ON) / `--ws-disabled` (mutex),
    `--candidate-pool-size`, `--active-detail-limit`,
    `--ws-staleness-threshold-ms`, `--candidate-ttl-seconds`. The
    runner pumps WS -> ingest into radar -> score every snapshot
    -> offer to pool -> expire stale candidates -> drive
    WSRadarChainDriver on the active head (skipped while
    `ws_client.is_stale=True`, the data-degraded gate); the
    active head also receives REST detail through the existing
    PR-A governor.

### Real routed public WS adapter

PR #32 ships the real-network public WebSocket adapter inline.
**`StdlibPublicWSTransport`** is a single-class, stdlib-only RFC
6455 client; **`MultiTransportPublicWSManager`** owns one of those
adapters per route (PUBLIC + MARKET) and presents them behind a
single `WSMessagePump` interface. The pair targets the documented
Binance USDⓈ-M Futures routed endpoints
(`wss://fstream.binance.com/public/stream` and
`wss://fstream.binance.com/market/stream`). The unrouted
`wss://fstream.binance.com/stream?streams=...` path silently
drops market-class streams (per the Binance public-WS reference)
and is therefore NOT the acceptance path; the routed-private
endpoint `wss://fstream.binance.com/private` is forbidden at the
path-root allowlist (`FORBIDDEN_WS_PATH_ROOTS`). The adapter
performs the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade handshake (`GET <route>/stream` with
`Sec-WebSocket-Key` / `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13`), validates the
server's `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, parses RFC 6455 text frames, and
surfaces decoded `WSMessage` envelopes. The third-party WebSocket
package deny-list (`websockets` / `websocket-client` / `aiohttp` /
`requests` / `httpx` / `urllib3`) in
`tests/unit/test_phase11c_no_network.py` continues to hold.

The runner refuses to silently fall back to the PR-A
bootstrap-only REST path: `--ws-first` without `--dry-run`
**requires** a real public WS pump. If the factory returns
`None` or raises, the runner exits with `rc=2` and the message
`real public WebSocket transport is required for --ws-first
without --dry-run`. The only path to REST-only operation is the
explicit `--ws-disabled` flag, documented as NOT the Phase 11C.1B
acceptance path.
